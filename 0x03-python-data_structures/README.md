0x03. Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

Task 0 - Print a list of integers

Write a function that prints all integers of a list
format: one integer per line
you are not allowed to import any module
you can assume that the list only contains integers
you are not allowed to cast integers into strings
you have to use str.format() to print integers

Task 1 - Secure access to an element in a list

Write a function that retrieves an element from a list like in C
if idx is negative the function should return none
if idx is our of range (>of the number of element in my_list), the function
should return none
you are not allowed to import any module
you are not allowed to use try/except

Task 2 - Replace element

Write a function that replaces an element at a specific position (like in C)
if idx is negative, the function should not modify anything, and returns the
original list
If idx is out of range (> of number of element in my_list)
the function should not modify anything, and returns the original list
You are not allowed to import any module
You are not allowed to use try/except

Task 3 - Print a list of integers... in reverse

Write a function that prints all integers of a list in reverse order
format: one integer per line
you are not allowed to import any module
you can assume that the list only contains integers
you are not allowed to cast integers into a string
you have to use str.format() to print the integers

Task 4 - Replace in a copy

Write a function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position
without modifying the original list (like in C).
If idx is negative, the function should return a copy of the original list
If idx is out of range (> of number of element in my_list)
the function should return a copy of the original list
you are not allowed to import any module
You are not allowed to use try/except
